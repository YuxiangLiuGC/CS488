Q2:

Latency:100ms
throughput:3.5 Mbits/sec

Average RRT:200ms
Measured throughput:3.5 Mbits/sec

use parameter 20 seconds to test.

Q3: 

Two pairs of hosts:
Latency:80ms
throughput:20 Mbits/sec
Average RTT:165ms
Measured throughput:20 Mbits/sec

Three paris of hosts:
Latency:80ms 
throughput:7.5 Mbits/sec
Average RTT:165ms
Measured throughput:7.73 Mbits/sec

From two pairs of hosts to three pairs of hosts, throughput droped from 20 to 7.73 Mbits/sec.

Q4:

h1-h4:
Latency:80ms 
throughput:17Mbits/sec
Average RTT:165ms
Measured throughput:17.5Mbits/sec

use parameter 20 seconds to test.

h5-h6:
Latency:20ms 
throughput:25Mbits/sec
Average RTT:45ms
Measured throughput:25.6Mbits/sec

use parameter 20 seconds to test.
